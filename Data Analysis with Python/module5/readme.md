# üîç Module 5: Model Evaluation and Refinement

This module focuses on the crucial process of evaluating and refining data models. You will learn to identify overfitting and underfitting, explore model selection techniques, and apply Ridge Regression to regularize models and avoid overfitting. Additionally, you will understand and implement Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning.

## üß∞ Key Concepts Covered

- **Overfitting vs Underfitting:** Understanding when a model is too complex or too simple  
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model complexity to balance bias and variance  
- **Ridge Regression:** Regularization technique that adds a penalty to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting  
- **Grid Search:** Systematic way of tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance

## üìù Summary

You now understand how to evaluate your regression models critically and refine them to improve their generalization. Using Ridge Regression helps mitigate overfitting by regularizing coefficients, while Grid Search automates hyperparameter tuning for better predictive accuracy.
