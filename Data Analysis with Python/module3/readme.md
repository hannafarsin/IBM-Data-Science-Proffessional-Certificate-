## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Implement basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, quartiles)
- Demonstrate grouping data techniques (using GroupBy in Python)
- Describe and apply data correlation methods (Pearson correlation)
- Perform Chi-square tests for associations between categorical variables
