# üìä Module 4: Model Development

In this module, you will learn to define explanatory and response variables, understand simple vs. multiple linear regression, and evaluate models through visualization and numeric measures. You will explore polynomial regression, pipelines, and apply metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess model fit. Finally, you will learn prediction and decision-making based on model results.
