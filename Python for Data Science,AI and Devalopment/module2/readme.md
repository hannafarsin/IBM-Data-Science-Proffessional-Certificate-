# 🧩 Module 2: Python Data Structures

This module begins the journey into Python data structures. You'll start with **lists** and **tuples**, understanding how they store collections of data. Then you’ll explore **dictionaries**, which store data in key-value pairs, and finally, you'll learn about **sets**, a collection type that only stores unique elements and does not maintain order.
