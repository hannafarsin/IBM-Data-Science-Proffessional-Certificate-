# 🚀 Falcon 9 First-Stage Landing Data Exploration

In this module, we collect and analyze data on Falcon 9 first-stage landings using a combination of **RESTful API calls**, **web scraping**, and **data wrangling** in Python. The data is transformed into a structured **pandas DataFrame**, allowing us to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and build visual insights that support modeling tasks.
