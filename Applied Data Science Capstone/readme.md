# ðŸš€ Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM

## About This Course
The final course in the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** and the **Applied Data Science with Python Specialization**.  
This capstone project simulates real-world data science work by guiding you through the complete data science workflow on a challenging and relevant problem.

You will play the role of a Data Scientist for a startup competing against SpaceX by predicting if the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.  
Your insights will help your startup make competitive bids on rocket launches by estimating launch costs based on reusable rocket stages.

This course focuses on hands-on application of everything you've learned â€” from data collection and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visualization, to building and evaluating predictive models â€” culminating in presenting your results.
