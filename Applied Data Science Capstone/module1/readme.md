###  Predictive Analysis (Classification)

In this module, you will use machine learning to determine if the **first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket** will land successfully. You will:

- Split your dataset into **training and testing sets**.
- Train multiple **classification models**, including:
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Classification Trees
  - Logistic Regression
- Use **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluate and select the best-performing model using test data.

#### Learning Objectives
- Split the data into training and test sets
- Train different classification models
- Optimize hyperparameters using Grid Search
- Apply your ML skills to build a business-useful predictive model
