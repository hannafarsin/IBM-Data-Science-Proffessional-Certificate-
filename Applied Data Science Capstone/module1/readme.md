# 🚀 Capstone Project: Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landing
## 📘 Project Overview

In this capstone, the goal is to predict whether the **Falcon 9 first stage** will land successfully.

> SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of **$62 million**, significantly less than the **$165 million** charged by other providers. A major factor in this cost reduction is the **reusability of the Falcon 9 first stage**.  
>  
> Therefore, by determining the likelihood of a successful first-stage landing, we can estimate the **potential cost savings** and make informed decisions—useful especially for companies competing with SpaceX.
