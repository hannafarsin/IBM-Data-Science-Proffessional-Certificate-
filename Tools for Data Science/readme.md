# 🧰 Tools for Data Science by IBM

## 📘 About this Course

In order to be successful in Data Science, you need to be skilled with using tools that Data Science professionals employ as part of their jobs. This course teaches you about the popular tools in Data Science and how to use them.

You will become familiar with the Data Scientist’s tool kit which includes: Libraries & Packages, Data Sets, Machine Learning Models, Kernels, as well as the various Open source, Commercial, Big Data and Cloud-based tools.

Work with **Jupyter Notebooks**, **JupyterLab**, **RStudio IDE**, **Git**, **GitHub**, and **Watson Studio**. You will understand what each tool is used for, what programming languages they can execute, their features, and limitations.

This course gives plenty of hands-on experience in order to develop skills for working with these Data Science Tools. With the tools hosted in the cloud on Skills Network Labs, you will be able to test each tool and follow instructions to run simple code in Python, R, or Scala.

## 🎯 Learning Goals for the Course

In this course, you will be introduced to a Data Scientist's workbench or toolkit that consists of a variety of tools, languages, libraries, APIs, data sets, models, etc. used by Data Scientists.

You don’t need to memorize every tool mentioned. Instead, you’ll gain a clear understanding of categories and examples of tools, getting hands-on experience with a few key ones. As you progress through the specialization, you’ll revisit and use more tools and libraries in depth.

✅ You need to complete the **first 6 out of 7** modules to successfully finish the course. Module 7 is optional.
