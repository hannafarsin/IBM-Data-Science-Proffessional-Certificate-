# 📘 Module 5: RStudio and GitHub

## 🧠 Overview  
R is a statistical programming language and a powerful tool for data processing and manipulation. This module begins with an introduction to **R** and **RStudio**, covering R's visualization packages and demonstrating how to create visual charts using the `plot()` function.

You’ll also dive into **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**, with a strong focus on **Git** and **GitHub**. Through hands-on labs and examples, you'll learn how to create repositories, commit changes, manage branches, and collaborate using pull requests. By the end of the module, you'll complete a practical project to apply these skills.
