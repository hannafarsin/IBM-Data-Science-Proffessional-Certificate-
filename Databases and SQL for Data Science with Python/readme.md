# 📘 Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
*by IBM*

---

## 🧠 About this Course

Much of the world’s data resides in databases, and **Structured Query Language (SQL)** is the key to unlocking and analyzing that data.

This course is designed for aspiring **Data Scientists**, **Data Analysts**, and **Data Engineers**. You will start with basic SQL and gradually move toward advanced concepts like **JOINs**, **Stored Procedures**, and **ACID Transactions**.

By the end, you’ll be confident in querying databases, using SQL with Python in Jupyter Notebooks, and applying your knowledge to real-world datasets.

## ✅ What You Will Learn

- Write foundational SQL statements: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Use filtering clauses: `WHERE`, `COUNT`, `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT`
- Differentiate between **DML** & **DDL**
- Create, alter, drop, and load tables
- Work with **string patterns**, **ranges**, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and **built-in functions**
- Build **sub-queries** and query data from **multiple tables**
- Access and manipulate databases using **Python and Jupyter Notebooks**
- Work with advanced SQL concepts: **Stored Procedures**, **Views**, **Transactions**, **INNER & OUTER JOINs**

You will practice with **cloud-based labs** and a **final project** analyzing real-world datasets from the city of Chicago.
