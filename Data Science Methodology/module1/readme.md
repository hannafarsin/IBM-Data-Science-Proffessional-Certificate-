# Module 1: From Problem to Approach and From Requirements to Collection

## Overview

In this module, you will discover what makes data science interesting, learn what a data science methodology is, and why data scientists need one. Next, you’ll gain in-depth knowledge of the first two stages of data science methodology: **Business Understanding** and **Analytic Approach**. You'll learn to identify the steps and considerations needed to define data requirements for decision tree classification during the Data Requirements stage. You will also explore techniques used to assess data content, quality, and insights, and how to manage data gaps. Finally, you’ll round out this module with practical hands-on experience by addressing tasks in the Business Understanding and Analytic Approach stages as well as the Data Requirements and Collection stages for any data science problem.
