# Module 4: Final Project and Assessment

## Overview

Before completing your final project, learn how CRISP-DM data science methodology compares to John Rollinsâ€™ foundational data science methodology. Then, apply what you learned to complete a peer-graded assignment using CRISP-DM to solve a business problem you define. In this module, you will first adopt both the client and the data scientist roles to describe how you would use CRISP-DM to address a business problem. After submitting your work, you will review and grade one peer's assignment. Let's get started!
