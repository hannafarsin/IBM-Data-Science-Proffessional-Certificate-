# Module 3: From Deployment to Feedback

## Overview

In this module, you’ll learn how to describe and execute the final stages of the data science methodology—**Deployment** and **Feedback**. You will learn how to assess a data model’s performance, impact, and readiness, and identify the stakeholders involved in refining the model. You’ll understand why both deployment and feedback must be iterative processes.

Through hands-on lab activities, you will devise a business problem (using data related to email, hospitals, or credit cards) to solve using the CRISP-DM framework. You’ll construct detailed responses that address each phase of the methodology based on your chosen business problem. Finally, you’ll evaluate your peers’ final projects, providing constructive feedback and actionable suggestions.
