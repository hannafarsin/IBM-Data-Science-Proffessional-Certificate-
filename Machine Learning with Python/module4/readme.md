## 📌 Key Concepts

### Logistic Regression
- Used for binary classification problems.
- Outputs probabilities using the sigmoid function.
- Trained via minimizing a cost function using gradient descent.
- Can be extended for multi-class classification.

### Linear vs Logistic Regression
- Linear regression predicts continuous values.
- Logistic regression predicts probabilities for classification.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
- Uses kernel tricks to handle non-linear separation.

### Multi-class Prediction
- Extends binary classifiers to handle multiple classes via strategies like one-vs-rest or one-vs-one.
