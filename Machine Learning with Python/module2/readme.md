## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Simple Linear Regression** models the relationship between two continuous variables.
- **Multiple Linear Regression** allows modeling multiple features to predict an output.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – average of absolute differences.
  - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** – penalizes larger errors more.
  - **R² Score** – indicates how well the model fits the data (1 is perfect).
