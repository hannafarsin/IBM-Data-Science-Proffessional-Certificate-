## 📌 Key Concepts

### K-Means Clustering
- An **unsupervised learning** algorithm used to group data points into **k clusters** based on feature similarity.
- Iteratively assigns points to clusters and recalculates cluster centroids until convergence.
- Commonly used for **customer segmentation** and market analysis.
- Accuracy depends on proper selection of **k** and initial centroid placement.
