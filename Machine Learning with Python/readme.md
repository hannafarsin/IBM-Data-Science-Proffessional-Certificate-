# 🤖 IBM Data Science Professional Certificate – Course 4: Machine Learning with Python

## 📘 About this Course
This course introduces the foundational concepts of **machine learning (ML)** using **Python**—the most in-demand language for ML jobs. You will gain practical experience building models with **Scikit-learn**, working in **Jupyter Notebooks**, and applying statistical methods such as **regression**, **classification**, and **clustering**.

Throughout the course, you’ll:
- Understand the iterative nature of ML model development
- Explore **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning techniques
- Learn about model evaluation, bias-variance tradeoff, and tuning

By the end, you’ll be able to apply essential ML techniques and showcase your skills in a **peer-reviewed project** and **final exam**.
